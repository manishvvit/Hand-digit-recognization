# Hand Digit Recognition Using OpenCV

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a hand digit recognition system using OpenCV. The system can accurately identify and recognize hand-written digits in images, leveraging machine learning techniques and the power of OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition:** Accurately identifies digits (0-9) from hand-written input.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of recognizing digits in real-time from video streams.
- **Robust Performance:** High accuracy achieved through comprehensive training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (or any other machine learning library)
2. 
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional for using deep learning models)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-digit-recognition.git
   cd hand-digit-recognition

## Install the required packages
2. pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras
## Run the file
